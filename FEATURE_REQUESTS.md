# Feature Requests

## 1. Re theme the UI

- Refactor the UI to be calmer, more like the Anthropic/Claude website UIs, or the Zen Browser website UI.
- Use EB Garamond, light cream calm colors (and a corresponding charcoal in darkmode) and pastel accents. Focus on typography.
- Keep the structure, functionality and layout the exact same. Just tweak the theme.
- Simplify UI elements such as drag handles, and make sure buttons and controls are thematically consistent.
- Ensure dark mode is thematically consistent, and legible.
